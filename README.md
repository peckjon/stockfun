## Toying around with stock data using GitHub Actions

Some toy examples to scrape stock data using Pandas and plot it via Matplotlib, running on GitHub Actions

#### Selecting the stocks

Edit stocks.csv

#### Generating the plot

This will run automatically (see .github/workflows/) and place a PNG in the repo

#### Try it yourself

Read more about [GitHub actions](https://github.com/features/actions), then clone this repository and commit a change to the stocks.csv file. Click the "Actions" tab at the top of your repo to examine the run, then check to see if the plot has changed.
